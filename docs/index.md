Siddhi Android Platform
===========

Siddhi Android Platform is a wrapper for Siddhi. It allows android developers to embed Siddhi as a service. 
Siddhi is a java library that listens to events from data streams, detects complex conditions described via a **Streaming
 SQL language**, and triggers actions. It performs both **_Stream Processing_** and **_Complex Event Processing_**.
